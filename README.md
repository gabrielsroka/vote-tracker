# Track Changes to Vote Totals in Real-time

By polling the WSJ JSON feed, this Node.JS script will print to the console any changes in the vote counts for a list of states you care about.

More importantly, it will tell you only when something changes, and the delta in each candidate's total number of votes since the last change.

Feel free to add Twilio SMS notifications, curses UI, or fork as you see fit.
